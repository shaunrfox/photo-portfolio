		<p>Hi there, I&rsquo;m Shaun.</p>

		<p>As I go through life, I try to find interesting or beautiful things to capture along the way, and I find a lot of them in day-to-day life &ndash; from people I&rsquo;m with to the spaces we&rsquo;re in. This is a portfolio of my favorites.</p>

		<p>You can <a href="https://shaunfox.typeform.com/to/yshc4b" target="_blank">get in touch with me here</a>.
