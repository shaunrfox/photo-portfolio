		<p>Hi there, I&rsquo;m Shaun.</p>

		<p>As I go through life, I try to find interesting or beautiful things to capture along the way, and I find a lot of them in day-to-day life &ndash; from people I&rsquo;m with to the spaces we&rsquo;re in. This is a portfolio of my favorites.</p>

		<p>You can <a href="https://shaunfox.typeform.com/to/yshc4b" target="_blank">get in touch with me here</a>.
		</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in prints, I&rsquo;m trying out a new printing service where I have a few photos available for purchase in various sizes. <a href="https://shaunfox.darkroom.tech/" target="_blank">Check out the images here</a>.</p>
